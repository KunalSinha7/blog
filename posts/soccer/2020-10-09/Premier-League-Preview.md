The transfer window is over and a few matchdays have passed, so there is no better time to bring out my predictions for the 2020-21 Premier League Season. In the midst of coronavirus pandemic clubs have taken several different approaches to transfers, with some preferring to seek bargains and keep costs down and others preferring to all out in order to take advantage of other teams' precarious financial situations. After a few matchdays, each team is also starting to show whether or not they are going to stick or twist with their style of play, making this a great time to make my predications.

**20th - Fulham** 



**2nd - Liverpool**

**1st - Manchester City**
